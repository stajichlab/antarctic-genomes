Rsp_CCFEE5018.Satsuma_scaf.agp comes from first run Satsuma2 to Synteny scaffold the Rsp CCFEE5018 genome to the R.antarticum CCFEE5527 genome (which assembled much better). The updated AGP for the original assembly scaffolded is Rsp_CCFEE5018.Satsuma_scaf.acc.agp which refers to a contig ordering of the original submitted genome assembly.

The goal of this is to super scaffold the CCFEE5018 genome with a close relative to reduce the total number of scaffolds in order to meet GenomeAnnouncements policy of < 1000 contigs in a genome announcement. 

I suspect the assembly quality problem is due to fragmented input DNA. The gene count is quite comparable (~18k) for each genome so I think gene space is captured similarly.
